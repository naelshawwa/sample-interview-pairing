# We're building yet another recipe
The Internet doesn't have enough recipe websites so we've built yet another one. Let's use the following codebase as our starter for your coding interview.

You can use any resources available online, yes, even ChatGPT but the only rule is you share your screen the whole time so we can pair together.

## How to get this started?
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
