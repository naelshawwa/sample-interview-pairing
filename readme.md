# We're building yet another recipe
The Internet doesn't have enough recipe websites so we've built yet another one. Let's use the following codebase as our starter for your coding interview.

You can use any resources available online, yes, even ChatGPT but the only rule is you share your screen the whole time so we can pair together.

## How to get this started?
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You should see a recipe gallery.

We're now going to work together on implementing various improvements to this codebase. 

# Task 1 - Refactoring
Before we start building new things, we'd like to improve the foundations of what we've got so far. The landing page `page.tsx` as you can see is just one component. How can we improve this? We'd like to start building our own component library of re-usable pieces. We've already started using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as our CSS framework so please continue to utilize that as needed. Feel free to use their [documentation](https://tailwindui.com/components?ref=sidebar) for reference. Discuss what you would do and then let's go ahead and make these changes.
